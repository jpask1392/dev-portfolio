Browsing many tech related information sites/blogs, I recognized PHP as a staple part of a developers toolbox and set out on learning the server side language. I took my existing static HTML site and began swapping out reusable elements with php to condense the code. I also built an SQL database for storing project data."},{"images":["projects/arch-portfolio/arch-portfolio-image-five.jpg","projects/arch-portfolio/arch-portfolio-image-six.jpg","projects/arch-portfolio/arch-portfolio-image-seven.jpg"],"_id":{"$oid":"5cf6d839d9794b0ea3db5870"},"title":".SQL","text":"Condensing my existing portfolio with the implementation of PHP led me to learning more about databases and their uses. I set up an SQL database and accessed the information with the MySqli API within my PHP files. This control over the back end took my interest and I began to develop a content management system I could use for easy content control. I incorporated industry standard security techniques to prevent various malicious attacks including cross site scripting and SQL injection. I am still constantly learning about the mammoth topic of web security and look to incorporate these into future projects."},{"images":["projects/arch-portfolio/arch-portfolio-image-eight.jpg","projects/arch-portfolio/arch-portfolio-image-nine.jpg","projects/arch-portfolio/arch-portfolio-image-ten.jpg"],"_id":{"$oid":"5cf6d839d9794b0ea3db586f"},"title":".CSS","text":"The sites design was to emphasize the work produced at both University and EPT partnership. The logo - designed to resemble ‘JP’ - was created with illustrator and animated using CSS. Photoshop and a variety of both paid and free 3D rendering softwares were used to to produce the images displayed on the site. A lot was learned while working on this project, from folder structure to the interaction of third party libraries."}],"__v":0,"projectHeaderImage":"projects/arch-portfolio/phone.png"}

Webpack, Babel, Express and React are among some of the dependencies researched and incorporated into this project. To keep up with the latest version of javascript, ES6 syntax was used throughout and converted to browser understandable code with Babel. ES6, along with React’s creation of JSX has also been used for the sites front end creation.

SCSS files were chosen to control the design due to its use of variables for easy future updates and its ability to embed code for readability. These files were then transpilled with Babel and merged together to reduce calls to the server. Consciousness of these subtle performance enhancements allow for smoother user experiences. Responsive design through media queries are also included to provide the same experience over multiple devices."},{"images":["projects/dev-portfolio/dev-portfolio-image-eight.jpg","projects/dev-portfolio/dev-portfolio-image-nine.jpg","projects/dev-portfolio/dev-portfolio-image-ten.jpg"],"_id":{"$oid":"5cf6d863f4901e0eb2720664"},"title":".BSON","text":"The noSQL database technology, mongoDB, was used to store the project information. This data is accessed with various API endpoints set up on a running Node/expressJS server. This data was then used to dynamically populate template React components saving time and file size repeating very similar code. This also allowed for future application scaling when required. This future scaling has been kept in mind throughout the entire development process."}],"__v":0,"projectHeaderImage":"projects/dev-portfolio/phone.png"}
