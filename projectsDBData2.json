I first began with a basic HTML/CSS site, then moved towards the incorporation of javascript, and finally used PHP to develop a more dynamic, condensed website. Through research of websites, I recognized PHP as a staple aspect of any developers toolbox, further leading to my discovery of server side languages. I took my existing static HTML site and began swapping out reusable elements with PHP to condense the code as well as building an SQL database for storing project data."},{"images":[{"filePath":"projects/arch-portfolio/arch-portfolio-image-five.jpg","description":"Login page data validation"},{"filePath":"projects/arch-portfolio/arch-portfolio-image-six.gif","description":"Login page data validation"},{"filePath":"projects/arch-portfolio/arch-portfolio-image-seven.jpg","description":"Custom CMS design"}],"_id":{"$oid":"5cf6d839d9794b0ea3db5870"},"title":".SQL","text":"Condensing my existing portfolio with the implementation of PHP led to my interest in learning more about databases and their uses. I set up an SQL database and accessed the stored records with the MySqli API. This type of control over the back end peaked my interest and further enabled my development of a content management system for easier content control. I incorporated industry standard security techniques to prevent various malicious attacks including cross site scripting and SQL injection.

This specific site forced a wide understanding of web development from folder structure to the interaction of third party libraries.
